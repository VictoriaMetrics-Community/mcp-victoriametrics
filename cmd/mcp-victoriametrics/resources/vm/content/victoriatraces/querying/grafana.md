> VictoriaTraces is currently under active development and not ready for production use. It is built on top of VictoriaLogs and therefore shares some flags and APIs. These will be fully separated once VictoriaTraces reaches a stable release. Until then, features may change or break without notice.

[Grafana Jaeger Datasource](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/jaeger/) allows you to query and visualize VictoriaTraces data in Grafana.

![Visualization with Grafana](grafana-jaeger.webp)

Simply click "Add new data source" on Grafana, and then fill your VictoriaTraces URL to "Connection.URL". 

The URL format for VictoriaTraces single-node is:
```
http://<victoria-traces>:10428/select/jaeger
```

Finally, click "Save & Test" at the bottom to complete the process.
