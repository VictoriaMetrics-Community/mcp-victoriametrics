VictoriaMetrics is proud to be a Silver Sponsor at KubeCon North America 2024, which will take place in Salt Lake City in just a few weeks. This key event focuses on Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.

After participating at KubeCon Paris and KubeCon China earlier this year, we are eager to showcase our latest innovations and connect with participants starting November 12th.

This event offers a unique opportunity to engage with our Founders and the rest of the team, learn whatâ€™s next for VictoriaMetrics, and discuss how our open source projects and solutions can help with your monitoring and observability requirements.

Thereâ€™s still time register for the conference [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/).
