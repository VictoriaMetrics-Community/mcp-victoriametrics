#### **The war starts | We will be unavailable some days | I will try to post updates | Stay safe**

This was the first message posted in our company Slack channel on February 24th 2022 exactly one year ago.

What followed were days and weeks of high intensity that would lead us to declaring ‘Resilience’ our word for 2022 in our recent [2022 momentum blog post](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/momentum-2022/).

Today we reiterate our position with regards to Russia’s war on Ukraine:

War is a crime, and we unequivocally condemn Russia’s actions - please read our full statement below. We will stick to these principles until Ukraine achieves victory and beyond.


### Our Team


Everyone on the VictoriaMetrics team is fine, and we’ve continued our work, uninterrupted, full speed ahead with our regular releases and customer support.

In many ways, our work has had a salvatory effect on us and we’ve worked even harder than before.

As a result, we came out with 31 new releases during the course of 2022 and VictoriaMetrics downloads hit the 100M+ mark.

Today, the VictoriaMetrics team is globally distributed across North America, Asia and several countries in Europe with its heart beating in and for Ukraine.

This is a follow up to our statements from February [28th 2022](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/no-war/) & [April 15th 2022](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/april-2022-company-status-update/).


#### **Our updated statement regarding the attack and war that were launched by Russia on Ukraine one year ago, February 24th 2022, and that still rage on to this day.**

We continue to condemn Russia’s treacherous attack led by Vladimir Putin on Ukraine and its people, the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages as well as the cyber & disinformation wars that Russia is still directing at Ukraine.

We stand by everyone in Ukraine fighting for our collective freedom and with all those showing support and providing help.

We also stand by all those in Russia who are opposed to the war and are taking risks themselves by expressing their support for Ukraine and peace.

We created VictoriaMetrics as a space for open discourse, tolerance and mutual respect, creativity and fair competition for all.

We are makers of open source technology and we stand by all those who contribute to open societies.

We continue our work on VictoriaMetrics with determination and we encourage our users to do the same as well as continue to contribute to the open source community at large.

We continue to stay safe and do what we can alongside everyone else to protect Ukraine and achieve peace for all.

To everyone wanting to help, please consider contributing to the Come Back Alive Foundation:
