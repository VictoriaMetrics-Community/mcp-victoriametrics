![Heading to London: Meet Our Team at KubeCon Europe 2025](/blog/heading-to-london-meet-our-team-at-kubecon-europe-2025/preview.webp)

VictoriaMetrics is proud to be a Silver Sponsor at KubeCon Europe 2025, which takes place in London this year from April 1st to 4th.

We are eager to showcase our latest innovations and connect with participants after participating at KubeCon Salt Lake City in 2024, Fosdem, and SCaLE 22x earlier this year.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation‚Äôs most well-known conference brings together adopters and technologists from leading open-source and cloud-native communities.

This event offers a unique opportunity to engage with our Founders and the VictoriaMetrics team. Learn what‚Äôs next for VictoriaMetrics and discuss how our open-source projects and solutions can help with your monitoring and observability requirements.

There‚Äôs still time to register for the conference [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/).

## Meet the VictoriaMetrics Team @ Booth #N503

We look forward to connecting with the community, sharing insights on time series and log databases, monitoring and observability, and learning from the Open-Source community.

Say hello at booth #N503, meet our team, and learn about the latest updates on our new Log Management, VictoriaLogs, VictoriaMetrics Open Source, anomaly detection capabilities, and more.

## What to Expect from Us

We simplify complex monitoring setups and optimize performance for cloud-native environments. Whether starting or managing large-scale deployments, VictoriaMetrics has the right solution.

We‚Äôll also have new VictoriaMetrics hoodies, chocolate bars, tumblers, t-shirts, bags, and stickers.

### VictoriaLogs: Super-efficient, open source logs management

Since its first release, following in VictoriaMetrics‚Äô footsteps, VictoriaLogs has been about delivering top-notch performance without the hefty resource demands. It uses up to 30 times less RAM and up to 15 times less disk space than alternatives likeElasticsearch and Grafana Loki. This efficiency means VictoriaLogs can run smoothly on anything from a Raspberry Pi to high-end servers with hundreds of CPU cores and terabytes of RAM.
VictoriaLogs is a fast, flexible, and optimized open-source logs management solution.
Get [started](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/victorialogs-status-update-heading-towards-the-cluster-version/) today and come to talk to us at the conference for more information.

## VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection: ML-Optimized Observability

VictoriaMetrics [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/index.html), part of our Enterprise offering, automates anomaly detection in metrics data, reducing manual effort for SREs and DevOps teams. Unlike static thresholds, it provides a stable, interpretable ML-powered anomaly score that adapts over time through continuous model retraining. This allows teams to detect and respond to issues faster while minimizing maintenance overhead.
