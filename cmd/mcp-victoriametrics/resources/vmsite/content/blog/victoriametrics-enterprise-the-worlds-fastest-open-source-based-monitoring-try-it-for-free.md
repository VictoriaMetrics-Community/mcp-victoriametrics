We’re happy to announce that we now offer a free trial of our VictoriaMetrics Enterprise solution!

Designed to help solve an organization’s monitoring and observability set ups, no matter the scale, [VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](/products/enterprise/) provides reliable, secure and cost-efficient monitoring.

[The free trial](/products/enterprise/trial/) of VictoriaMetrics Enterprise is perfect for organizations with large data loads, for whom cost-efficient monitoring is mission-critical. It is ideally suited for those looking for performance, scalability and security combined with world-class technical support for peace of mind.

“When we started the Atlas Compute Cluster project more than 15 years ago, we were stuck with standard monitoring tools of the past, Nagios and Ganglia. We tested other available monitoring solutions like Prometheus but it never scaled well enough for us, then we discovered VictoriaMetrics. Acting as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus, we were able to set-up our initial test system within only 20 minutes. Two months in, we are about to replace our production monitoring and alerting infrastructure with VictoriaMetrics. With the Enterprise features, we will be able to keep our slightly down-sampled metrics for months, or years, instead of throwing everything away after two weeks as we do currently.”
