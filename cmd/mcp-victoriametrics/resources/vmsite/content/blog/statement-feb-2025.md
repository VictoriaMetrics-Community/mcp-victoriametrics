# VictoriaMetrics Stands with Ukraine
## 24th of February 2025 Statement

We continue to stand firmly with Ukraine in the face of Russia's full-scale invasion, which is now entering its 4th year. 
As a company with deep roots in Ukraine, we have been profoundly affected by the war, and our commitment to supporting Ukraine remains unwavering.

We strongly condemn Russia's treacherous war on Ukraine and want to express our unequivocal support for Ukraine and its people. We denounce the continued bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, as well as the cyber and disinformation wars waged by Russia for the past few years, which have recently intensified again.

Our position remains steadfast: War is a crime, and we condemn Russia's actions without reservation.

## Support for Ukraine and Our Team

Our team includes members who are from Ukraine, live in Ukraine, or have close ties to the country. Most of our colleagues who lived in Ukraine previously have safely relocated with their families.

However, we still have colleagues in Ukraine who continue to provide support to our users, customers and our team, under incredibly difficult circumstances. Their dedication is a testament to their resilience and commitment. We are grateful that our colleagues continue to be safe, and we appreciate the support and concern for their well-being.

## Business Continuity and Global Operations

Our commitment to operational excellence is reflected in the following:
* Our team is distributed across North America, Asia, and several countries in Europe, with our heart firmly rooted in Ukraine.
* Over the past years, we have achieved significant milestones, including 750+ million downloads, released new products, and have grown our team significantly.
* We ceased doing business with any firms based in Russia from the 24th of February 2022 onwards, aligning our business practices with our moral stance.
* Our focus remains on contributing to open societies and fostering a global community built on mutual respect and collaboration.

## Community and Open Source Contributions

VictoriaMetrics was created as a space for open discourse. We stand by all those who contribute to open societies and encourage our users to continue contributing to the open-source community. We take ongoing responsibility by blocking any messages defending Russiaâ€™s war on Ukraine from our channels, ensuring that our platforms remain spaces for peace and support.

## Call to Action

We encourage everyone to stand with Ukraine.

To those wanting to help, please consider contributing to the Come Back Alive Foundation, which provides crucial support to the Ukrainian military and humanitarian efforts:

With thanks,

The VictoriaMetrics Team
