As we concluded 2024 with sustained growth in both open source adoption and enterprise business, we thought: We're going to need some more help in 2025!

The launch of our new products, combined with our consistent user- and customer-centric approach, significantly contributed to this expansion. The positive adoption metrics we're witnessing as a result affirm our position as a globally trusted observability platform for both open source developers and enterprise communities. Exciting times!

## Taking a look back - and ahead

In 2024 we've:
* Continued to grow at 300%+
* Expanded global headcount by 50%
* Announced plenty of new open source releases
  * [VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/)
  * [VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/changelog/)

With 13K+ [GitHub](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics) Stars given to our products by the user community to date, we're excited and grateful to witness their growing popularity in the open source community. As a result, our team has seen 50% headcount growth in 2024 alone, primarily in engineering.

## Ending 2024 on a 300+% high

2024 has been a significant step forward for our company. We continued to grow at the same pace of 300%+ that we've seen in the previous years, with significant improvements in absolute numbers.

Staying self-funded thanks to our amazing customers, we focused on creating simple, yet efficient products for engineers.

## Taking on logs management

As you may have seen already, we officially announced the General Availability (GA) release of [VictoriaLogs](https://victoriametrics.com/products/victorialogs/), an open-source log management solution that redefines simplicity in log storage and analysis. With its user-friendly design, VictoriaLogs enables faster, more accessible log processing, allowing organisations to uncover valuable insights from their data effortlessly.

## Observability innovation

The release of VictoriaLogs complements the earlier launch of our AI-powered Anomaly Detection system, included in our [Enterprise](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/anomaly-detection/) offering. This advanced solution leverages neural networks to identify critical data trends, filtering out noise and ensuring teams are alerted only to significant anomalies.

The VictoriaMetrics  ecosystem was then further expanded when we announced [VictoriaMetrics Cloud](https://victoriametrics.com/products/cloud/), our hosted monitoring solution that scales effortlessly while reducing monitoring costs by 5x. VictoriaMetrics Cloud has already attracted customers such as cloud optimization solutions company Granulate.

As Timothy Sleptsov, Senior Software Engineer at Granulate, [explained in this post](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/victoriametrics-cloud-reduces-monitoring-costs-by-5x/):  "Due to VictoriaMetrics' high optimization features, it handles our volume of time series on relatively modest hardware, reducing our costs of metrics storage by approximately five times. We also started using VictoriaMetrics' tooling for ingesting and alerting, which has very rich functionality, and our developers enjoy using MetricsQL (a nice extension of PromQL), which has simplified many of our queries."

## Going further in 2025

In 2025, we're determined to go further: Double down on open source, further improve our metrics and logging solutions, and stick to our commitment to solve the main observability problem with simple, reliable, efficient and scalable open source solutions.

## Welcoming new talent to drive innovation

To keep pace with the soaring demand for our  time-series data and logs monitoring solutions, we've expanded our team by 50%. New additions include Customer Success Managers, a Cloud Product Lead, and engineers bolstering both open-source and enterprise offerings. This strategic growth underscores our dedication to delivering top-notch support and innovative solutions to our rapidly expanding and diverse customer base.

With that said, we're excited to share that we have positions currently open in engineering, marketing & sales.
