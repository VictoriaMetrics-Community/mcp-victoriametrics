## VictoriaMetrics Connects with the Open Source Community at LinuxFest Northwest 2025

The VictoriaMetrics team recently returned from a rewarding weekend at [LinuxFest Northwest (LFNW) 2025](https://lfnw.org/), held in the scenic city of Bellingham, Washington. Representing the team were co-founder Dima, Mathias, Marc, and supported by Shelby and Tamara. It was a fantastic opportunity to engage directly with the vibrant open-source community in the Pacific Northwest.

## A Hub of Activity: The VictoriaMetrics Booth

Our booth served as a central point for countless interesting conversations throughout the weekend. We were thrilled by the diverse crowd LFNW attracts. We spoke with enthusiastic high school students taking their first steps into technology, seasoned SREs and observability engineers from large retail and global food service brands, and technical staff from government agencies working on demanding metrics projects.

Common themes emerged quickly: the need for scalable monitoring solutions that can handle high cardinality, the desire to simplify complex observability stacks, and a strong interest in cost-effective alternatives to existing tools or managed services. It was gratifying to discuss how VictoriaMetrics' focus on performance, efficiency, and simplicity directly addresses these real-world challenges. We enjoyed diving into technical specifics and showcasing how VictoriaMetrics can make a difference. 

## Beyond the Booth: Community Spirit

LinuxFest Northwest excels at fostering a genuine sense of community. One memorable example was the organized group walk along the waterfront ‚Äì a great chance to chat informally with fellow attendees and speakers while enjoying the fresh air and beautiful views.

These interactions, both at the booth and during networking opportunities, highlight the collaborative spirit that drives open source forward.

## Looking Ahead

We left LFNW 2025 feeling energized by the community's passion and the widespread interest in building more efficient and reliable monitoring systems. The feedback and conversations were invaluable, reinforcing our commitment to developing powerful, easy-to-use observability solutions.

A sincere thank you to the LinuxFest Northwest organizers for their hard work in putting on such a well-run and engaging event, and to everyone who stopped by our booth.
