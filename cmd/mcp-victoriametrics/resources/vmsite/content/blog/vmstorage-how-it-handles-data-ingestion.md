title: "How vmstorage Handles Data Ingestion From vminsert"
summary: "This article explains how vmstorage processes incoming metrics, assigns unique IDs to timeseries, and organizes everything into different types of storage parts. The whole system is pretty clever - it uses in-memory buffers for speed, smart compression to save space, and has various watchdogs keeping an eye on things like disk space and data retention."

**vmstorage** is the component in VictoriaMetrics that handles the long-term storage of monitoring data. It receives data from vminsert, organizes the data into efficient storage structures, and manages how long the data is retained.

Before vminsert even sees the data, agents are out there collecting it. These agents gather metrics from various sources and then send them over to vminsert in batches. When vminsert receives the data, it compresses it into smaller packets, making it ready to send to vmstorage:

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Data ingestion pipeline from agents to vmstorage</figcaption>

vmstorage stores data on both disk and memory in an optimized way, allowing very fast querying later on.

It starts by opening a TCP listener on port 8400 (`-vminsertAddr`). This listener is designed to accept connections only from vminsert. And today, we will discuss how vmstorage handles data ingestion from vminsert.

If you have a topic in mind that you'd like us to cover, you can drop a DM to [X (@func25)](https://twitter.com/func25) or connect with us on [VictoriaMetrics' Slack](https://slack.victoriametrics.com/). We're always looking for ideas and will focus on the **most-requested** ones. Thanks for sharing your suggestions!

## Reading And Parsing Data

When vmstorage receives data, it doesn't read it immediately but first checks with the concurrency read limiter.

This limiter only allows 2x the number of CPU cores (`-maxConcurrentInserts`) to read data **simultaneously**. For example, if your setup has 2 cores, you'll get up to 4 readers working at the same time. If more readers attempt to access the data, they'll have to wait in line â€” but not indefinitely. Any request stuck in the queue for over a minute (`-insert.maxQueueDuration`) is rejected to maintain system efficiency under heavy load.

Now, vmstorage reads one block at a time from the stream. But what does a block look like?

![vmstorage sends an ack back to vminsert](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-ack-from-vmstorage.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vmstorage sends an ack back to vminsert</figcaption>

Each block begins with a simple header (8 bytes) that indicates the size of the block vmstorage needs to read.

This size is not supposed to exceed 100 MB. Interestingly, if you recall from the [How VictoriaMetrics Agent (vmagent) Works](/blog/vmagent-how-it-works), there's another limit of 32 MB per block at the agent level. After successfully receiving (but not yet processing) the block, vmstorage sends an `ACK` (acknowledgement) back to vminsert.

> [!TIP] Tip: Useful metrics
> - The current number of active connections from vminsert to vmstorage: `vm_vminsert_conns`.
> - How many times vmstorage failed to read from the stream: `vm_protoparser_read_errors_total`.
> - How many times sending an `ACK` back to the client failed: `vm_protoparser_write_errors_total`.
> - The total number of blocks successfully read: `vm_protoparser_blocks_read_total`.

There's an edge case worth noting: when vmstorage is running low on disk space, less than 10MB (`-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes`), it switches to read-only mode. In this mode, it sends back a `read-only ack` for received data but ignores the actual content. vminsert recognizes this `ack` and resends the data later.

vmstorage just reads the block as a stream of raw bytes, and those bytes don't make sense to it. It needs to parse them into metrics:

![Raw data block parsed into structured rows](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-block-from-vminsert.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Raw data block parsed into structured rows</figcaption>

You can see the structure of each row in the block, at least `24+n` bytes for each row. The metric raw name contains both the metric name and labels, such as `http_requests_total{job="my_app",instance="host1",path="/foo/bar"}`, but encoded in a specific format.

If the block is too big, vmstorage breaks it into smaller blocks, each containing a maximum of 10,000 rows, and inserts them into the internal storage. It exposes some metrics for this parsing process:

- How many blocks (10,000-row chunks) failed to parse: `vm_protoparser_parse_errors_total`.
- How many rows were successfully parsed from the big blocks to smaller ones: `vm_protoparser_rows_read_total`.

If the data is valid and the storage is writable, we're ready to go. Let's review the big picture:

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Reading and parsing data</figcaption>

## Finding TSID For Each Metric

Before understanding what TSID is, let's first build the context. Every piece of data, or metric row, comes with a few elements:

- A **metric name** like `http_requests_total`, which gives you a clear idea of what the data is tracking.
- A **set of labels** (optional) like `{job="my_app",instance="host1",path="/foo/bar"}`. These labels add extra context, helping to locate where the data is from or what it's monitoring.
- A **timestamp** in milliseconds, such as `1731892875512`, which tells when the data was captured. Metrics with timestamps more than 2 days into the future or past the retention policy are dropped.
- A floating-point **value**, like `25.1`, representing the actual data value.

![Example of structured timeseries data](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-row.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Example of structured timeseries data</figcaption>

vmstorage creates something called a "canonical metric name." It combines the metric name with the metric's **sorted labels**.

Labels are sorted to resolve the issue of two metrics with the same labels but in a different order, such as `metric_name{instance="host",job="app"}` and `metric_name{job="app",instance="host"}`, being treated as two separate timeseries. Once VictoriaMetrics has this sorted canonical name, it either finds or creates a unique identifier for that timeseries, called the **TSID** (TimeSeries ID).

![From metric name to TSID in VictoriaMetrics](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-name-to-tsid.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">From metric name to TSID in VictoriaMetrics</figcaption>

The **TSID** is basically a unique number (with other metadata) that represents the timeseries. Any changes to the metric name, key, value, or the order of labels will result in a brand new TSID.

Not every metric raw name requires building a TSID. vmstorage has an in-memory cache (or TSID cache) to directly map the raw name to the TSID:

![In-memory cache maps raw names to TSIDs](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-tsid-cache.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">In-memory cache maps raw names to TSIDs</figcaption>

If the metric is already in the cache, things move along quickly since there's no need to dig deeper.

But let's say we're out of luck, and the metric isn't in the cache. VictoriaMetrics treats it as a **slower insert** because it's... extremely slow. vmstorage then goes to **IndexDB** to look it up. IndexDB has its own memory cache, but after all, IndexDB is disk-based (you'll find IndexDB stored in the `{storageDataPath}/index` folder). In cache-miss cases, pulling data from disk is not efficient.

> [!TIP] Tip: Useful metrics
> - How many times vmstorage failed to find a metric in the cache: `vm_slow_row_inserts_total`.

Once the lookup succeeds, the result is cached to save time and avoid hitting the disk again for the same timeseries in the future.

![Fallback flow: cache to IndexDB to new TSID](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-cache-flow-indexdb.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Fallback flow: cache to IndexDB to new TSID</figcaption>

If the system can't find it in IndexDB either, it generates a new `TSID` for the time series and registers it in both the in-memory cache and IndexDB. Many entries are created in IndexDB:

- An entry to map the metric's date to the metric ID.
- An entry to map the metric ID to the TSID.
- An entry to map (date, metric) to the TSID.
- The metric name and each label in the metrics (e.g., `code="200"`, `path="/"`) also have their own entries mapped to the metric ID.
- And many more...

For more details, check out the [IndexDB brief](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#indexdb). We will explain it in another article about querying data, where it's more suitable to cover IndexDB.

Now, that's a lot of work for a new time series, right?

That's why keeping an eye on time series churn (how often new time series are created and old ones are dropped) is so important. A high churn rate can significantly impact performance or even crash the system because it's constantly generating new TSIDs and registering them.

> [!TIP] Tip: Useful metrics
> Total count of new time series created: `vm_new_timeseries_created_total`.

It's also recommended to keep your labels (key-value pairs) within a limited set. A common mistake is using too many values for a label, like `userID="X"`, `ip="Y"`, etc., where `userID`, `ip`, and similar values are **unbounded**.

The good news is that vmstorage lets you control how many new time series can be created in an hour (`-storage.maxHourlySeries`) and per day (`-storage.maxDailySeries`) to protect the system. Any new time series exceeding these limits will be rejected.

> [!TIP] Tip: Useful metrics
> How many rows ignored due to reasons like timestamps or series cardinality: `vm_rows_ignored_total{reason=*}`.

Now, letâ€™s update the big picture with a few changes at the end, so we can move on to the next step:

![Finding TSID for each metric](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-data-ingestion-big-picture-2.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Finding TSID for each metric</figcaption>

## Inserting Data to In-Memory Buffer

<!-- We ignore the edge case of timestamp boundary -->

After the IndexDB phase, those TSIDs are sorted. VictoriaMetrics takes the actual data sample, which includes the TSID, a timestamp, and a value, and places it into an in-memory buffer.

![vmstorage-rows-to-tsids](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-rows-to-tsids.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">From metric rows to TSIDs</figcaption>

This buffer is called **raw-row shards** and holds up to 8 MB of data, which comes out to about 149,796 rows. The number of shards for each partition (which represents one month of data) matches the number of CPU cores you have. So, if your machine has 4 cores, you'll get 4 shards, taking up to 32 MB maximum.

The buffer's name is quite telling; those TSIDs will be sharded and distributed into different raw-row shards.

![Data enters shards, pending rows, then in-memory parts](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-data-ingestion/vmstorage-raw-row-shards.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Data enters shards, pending rows, then in-memory parts</figcaption>

If a shard fills up, the rows are pushed into what's known as "**pending series**." From there, they wait to be grouped into an "LSM part" and eventually written to disk.

Note that the rows sitting in this sharded buffer **are not searchable** yet. So, if you try to query them using Grafana or another tool immediately after ingestion, they won't show up until they're flushed into an LSM part (the flushing happens in the background and LSM parts will be explained in the next article).

And just like that, the data ingestion process wraps up for this block. The system is ready to take on the next batch of metric rows and start the process all over again.

> How many errors occurred after processing this whole process: `vm_protoparser_process_errors_total`.
