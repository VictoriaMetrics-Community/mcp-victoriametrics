## VictoriaMetrics Cluster

A VictoriaMetrics cluster is made up of three main components: `vminsert`, `vmselect`, and `vmstorage`.

![Components of a VictoriaMetrics cluster explained](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/victoriametrics-cluster-architecture.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Components of a VictoriaMetrics cluster explained</figcaption>

Each component runs as an independent service. The system follows a shared-nothing architecture where components communicate over the network but do not share memory or disk. For example, `vmstorage-1` and `vmstorage-2` operate independently and have no knowledge of each other.

Each service can be scaled horizontally. You can add more `vmstorage` nodes to store more data or more `vmselect` nodes to handle more queries.

### vminsert: Data Ingestion

`vminsert` serves as the data ingestion frontend for `vmstorage`. It accepts metrics in various formats from many sources, including Prometheus remote write, InfluxDB line protocol, OpenTSDB, Graphite, Datadog, New Relic, and OpenTelemetry.

![vminsert receives, processes, and distributes data](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/vminsert-ingestion-dataflow-diagram.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vminsert receives, processes, and distributes data</figcaption>

It parses incoming data based on the specific protocol and applies relabeling rules to transform or filter metrics before storing them. The metrics are buffered and sent in batches to different `vmstorage` nodes.

The main role of `vminsert` is to distribute data efficiently. It uses consistent hashing on metric names and labels to shard data across `vmstorage` nodes. In addition to sharding, it supports data replication to improve durability and availability.

If a `vmstorage` node becomes unavailable, `vminsert` reroutes the data to healthy nodes. This keeps ingestion running without interruption, even if part of the cluster goes down. It favors availability over strict consistency in such cases.

For scalability, you can run multiple `vminsert` instances. These can be added behind a load balancer like `vmauth` to support higher ingestion rates without affecting other components.

### vmstorage: Data Storage

`vmstorage` has two main responsibilities:

1. It receives and stores incoming data from `vminsert` nodes.
2. It serves query requests from `vmselect` nodes.

`vmstorage` saves data to disk using a highly optimized format. It combines in-memory and on-disk storage, organizing data into parts of different sizes to improve both write and read performance. Each `vmstorage` node requires a dedicated data directory, set using the `-storageDataPath` parameter. This is where all time series data is stored.

Data retention is automatically managed using the `-retentionPeriod` flag. This defines how long data is kept before it is removed, helping to control disk usage over time.

![vmstorage nodes handle persistent metric storage](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/victoriametrics-storage-layer.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vmstorage nodes handle persistent metric storage</figcaption>

Beyond storing data, `vmstorage` manages internal resources. It maintains memory caches for frequently accessed data, runs background tasks, and monitors system metrics like disk space to ensure stable performance.

If available disk space becomes critically low, `vmstorage` can switch to read-only mode. This prevents data corruption while still allowing queries to be served.

### vmselect: Data Retrieval

`vmselect` is the query processing component in the VictoriaMetrics cluster architecture. It acts as the frontend for all read operations, handling client queries and coordinating with `vmstorage` nodes to retrieve and process data.

![vmselect handles all read-side query traffic](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/vmselect-data-retrieval-flow.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vmselect handles all read-side query traffic</figcaption>

When a client sends a query, `vmselect` breaks it down to identify the exact metrics requested. It sends these requests to all `vmstorage` nodes, waits for the responses, merges the results, and applies any required aggregation, rollup functions, etc. After processing, it returns a single, unified response to the client.

`vmselect` also includes a built-in web interface called "vmui" that helps users explore data visually, troubleshoot queries, and understand how collected metrics affect system performance.

## Single-node VictoriaMetrics

Unlike the cluster version, which splits responsibilities across multiple components (`vminsert`, `vmstorage`, and `vmselect`), the single-node version performs all these tasks within one process.

Single-node VictoriaMetrics is designed for vertical scaling instead of horizontal scaling. It scales by adding more CPU, memory, disk space, and IO capacity to a single machine. Performance tests show that it scales almost linearly with these resources.

In many small to medium-sized environments, the single-node version can outperform the cluster setup because it:

- avoids network overhead between internal components, which can reduce CPU and memory usage for the same workload
- is easier to set up and manage, requiring less configuration and maintenance

Still, it comes with some limitations:

- It depends on the durability of the storage defined by the `-storageDataPath` flag, while the cluster version supports replication across multiple nodes for better availability
- It does not support multi-tenancy, a feature in the cluster version that isolates users or organizations

![Comparing single-node and cluster deployment options](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/single-vs-cluster-comparison.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Comparing single-node and cluster deployment options</figcaption>

If your resources are limited and high availability is not a top priority, the single-node version is often the better choice.

It can handle tens of millions of active time series and ingest millions of samples per second on suitable hardware. Again, with the same workload, it typically runs faster and uses fewer resources than the cluster version.

> [!TIP] Single-Node VictoriaMetrics Can Achieve High Availability  
> A single-node VictoriaMetrics setup can also achieve high availability—similar to the cluster version—by running two identically configured VictoriaMetrics instances in separate data centers. See [High Availability](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#high-availability) for more details.

## vmagent: Metrics Collection Agent

`vmagent` serves as both a metrics collector and router. It can actively scrape Prometheus-compatible targets (like exporters) and receive metrics pushed via various protocols including Prometheus remote_write, InfluxDB line protocol, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Datadog, and more. 

This flexibility means it can integrate with virtually any metrics-producing system:

![vmagent is a feature-rich standalone agent](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/vmagent-overview.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vmagent is a feature-rich standalone agent</figcaption>

One of the key strengths of `vmagent` is its ability to process metrics before sending them. With its relabeling system, it can add, change, or remove labels from metrics. This helps clean up the data, organize metadata, filter out unwanted metrics, and route specific metrics to different storage targets.

`vmagent` is built for reliability. If remote storage becomes unavailable, it stores the metrics on disk and sends them later when the connection is back. 

To support replication and fault tolerance, `vmagent` can send the same metrics to more than one storage system at the same time. It can also split metrics across multiple storage systems.

For enterprise setups, `vmagent` supports integration with cloud message systems like Kafka and Google PubSub. This lets metrics move through existing messaging infrastructure.

## vmauth: Proxy with Load Balancing, Routing and Authentication

`vmauth` is an HTTP proxy in the VictoriaMetrics ecosystem. It helps with:

- Load balancing: `vmauth` can distribute requests across multiple backend services like VictoriaMetrics nodes or `vminsert` instances. It supports several strategies such as round-robin, least-loaded, or first available.

![vmauth distributes requests across multiple backend instances](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/vmauth-load-balancing.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">`vmauth` distributes requests across multiple backend instances</figcaption>

- Authentication and authorization: `vmauth` checks user credentials (tokens, basic auth, bearer tokens) against a configuration file. It controls which users can access which resources.
- Request routing: It routes incoming HTTP requests to the correct backend services. Routing decisions can be based on:
  - Authentication credentials
  - Request paths
  - HTTP headers
  - Query parameters

![User requests routed based on tokens or auth](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/vmauth-user-request-flow.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">User requests routed based on tokens or auth</figcaption>

- High availability proxy: `vmauth` can automatically fail over to standby backends if the primary ones become unavailable.
- TLS termination: It can accept HTTPS connections from clients and forward them to backends over HTTP.

## vmbackup: Backup Storage Incrementally

`vmbackup` creates backups from either single-node or cluster versions of VictoriaMetrics by using instant snapshots.

You do not need to stop your storage system to run a backup. The data remains available during the backup process.

![vmbackup creates and uploads snapshot backups](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/victoriametrics-backup-steps.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vmbackup creates and uploads snapshot backups</figcaption>

It supports full and incremental backups. If you point `vmbackup` to a destination that already contains a previous backup, it will automatically run an incremental backup. Only new or changed data is uploaded.

This helps save bandwidth and speeds up backup times, which is especially useful for large datasets. `vmbackup` supports a variety of storage options:
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Amazon S3
- Azure Blob Storage
- Any S3-compatible system like MinIO or Ceph
- Local filesystem

This gives you flexibility in how and where you store your backup data.

`vmbackup` is also fault-tolerant. If a backup is interrupted, you can restart it with the same parameters and it will resume from where it stopped.

To fully automate the backup process, VictoriaMetrics provides a companion tool called `vmbackupmanager`. It manages backup schedules and retention policies for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly backups using a rotation model similar to traditional backup systems.

## vmbackupmanager (Enterprise): Automate Backup Rotation

While `vmbackup` is useful for creating one-time backups, `vmbackupmanager` ([Enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/enterprise/)) solves the full backup lifecycle for time-series databases. It automates the entire process using a backup rotation model that is familiar to system administrators and database teams.

For teams managing VictoriaMetrics deployments, `vmbackupmanager` removes the need to build and maintain custom scripts or cron jobs. It takes care of:

- scheduling backups
- creating snapshots
- performing incremental backups
- verifying backup integrity
- cleaning up old backups based on retention rules

For important backups that must be preserved, `vmbackupmanager` offers a locking feature. You can mark backups as "locked" so they are not deleted by the retention policy.

![Schedule, restore, lock, and delete backups easily](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/automated-backup-rotation-flow.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Schedule, restore, lock, and delete backups easily</figcaption>

`vmbackupmanager` also supports built-in restore. You can define a "restore mark" to select the backup you want to recover, and the system will handle the restore process automatically.

## vmrestore: Restore from Backup

`vmrestore` restores backups created by `vmbackup` to a VictoriaMetrics instance.

It is important to run `vmrestore` only when the VictoriaMetrics server is stopped. The tool needs exclusive access to the data directory to ensure a reliable and consistent restore process.

![vmrestore recovers from snapshots created by vmbackup](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/snapshot-to-restore-pipeline.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vmrestore recovers from snapshots created by vmbackup</figcaption>

Like `vmbackup`, `vmrestore` supports incremental restore and is resilient to interruptions. If the process is stopped, it can be restarted and will continue from where it left off. For large-scale environments, `vmrestore` supports parallel processing using the `-concurrency` parameter.

## vmalert: Alerting and Recording

`vmalert` is the alerting and rule evaluation tool in the VictoriaMetrics ecosystem. It performs two main tasks:

- Running alerting rules that send notifications to systems like Alertmanager, Slack, email, or PagerDuty
- Running recording rules to precompute common metrics and reduce query load

Once configured, `vmalert` connects to your VictoriaMetrics storage and runs scheduled queries. Based on the results, it triggers alerts or records new metrics:

![vmalert executes alerting and recording rules](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/vmalert-alerting-recording-logic.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">vmalert executes alerting and recording rules</figcaption>

The tool is lightweight and can be scaled horizontally. You can run multiple `vmalert` instances with different rule files. This allows better organization of rules and adds redundancy.

By default, `vmalert` does not remember previous alert states after a restart. To keep alert history across restarts, configure it with `-remoteWrite.url` and `-remoteRead.url` pointing to your VictoriaMetrics instance. This setup keeps alerts active and consistent after restarts.

## vmctl: CLI Tool for Migration

`vmctl` is the official command-line tool for migrating data into VictoriaMetrics. It supports a wide range of source systems including Prometheus, Thanos, Cortex, Mimir, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, Promscale, and even other VictoriaMetrics instances.

![Unified migration from multiple TSDB sources](/blog/victoriametrics-getting-started/migrate-to-victoriametrics-overview.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Unified migration from multiple TSDB sources</figcaption>

You do not need to migrate all data at once. `vmctl` allows partial migration based on specific filters:

- Time range: Choose a start and end time to limit the data you import
- Label values: Only include time series that match certain label conditions
- Metric names: Filter by metric names, which are stored under the `__name__` label

You can also add new labels to each time series during the migration process.

In addition to data migration, `vmctl` includes verification features. It can check the integrity of exported data blocks from VictoriaMetrics to make sure they are complete and correct before importing them elsewhere.

<!-- During migration operations, vmctl displays real-time progress bars in the console, showing the percentage of completion for the current operation:

```shell
Processing ranges: 8798 / 8798 [██████████████████████████████████████████████████] 100.00%
``` -->
