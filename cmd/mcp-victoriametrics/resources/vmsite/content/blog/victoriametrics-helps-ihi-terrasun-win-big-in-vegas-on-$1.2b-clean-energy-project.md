We’re happy to announce that VictoriaMetrics, open source time-series database and monitoring solution, and [IHI Terrasun Solutions](https://www.ihiterrasun.com/), a leading energy storage system integrator, have partnered on one of North America’s largest clean energy projects!

The [Gemini Solar + Storage](https://www.primergygemini.com/) project, which is carefully situated on less than 5,000 acres, is designed to provide clean energy for up to 10% of Nevada’s electricity needs during peak use times.

VictoriaMetrics’ advanced open source database and monitoring solution plays a pivotal role in optimizing the output from over 1.8 million solar modules and maintaining the battery health of [its 1,4 GWh storage system, one of the largest in the world](https://www.energy-storage.news/contractors-1416mwh-bess-colocated-gemini-project-in-nevada/).<br/>

## Enterprise edition becomes the data management solution of choice

To effectively manage the vast amounts of data generated by Gemini's solar panels and battery storage systems, IHI Terrasun implemented a solution that could handle millions of metrics per second with exceptional accuracy and efficiency. Traditional data handling systems were inadequate due to their inability to scale with higher data demand, leaving the data science and data management teams at IHI Terrasun to seek a more advanced solution. After careful evaluation and market research, selecting [VictoriaMetrics’ Enterprise](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/) solution was the clear choice.

*"VictoriaMetrics is an essential part of data management for the Gemini project and is the backbone of IHI Terrasun’s data collection and management system. The platform's ability to handle massive datasets with ease has been invaluable”*, explained **Larry Kane, SVP of Project and Product Engineering at IHI Terrasun**. *“We use the data to generate operational insights for maintenance and optimization, which is essential for the health of the project. The VictoriaMetrics team’s resourcefulness and quick response makes them a great partner in this technically challenging endeavor."*

## Stalwartly reliable and cost-effective real-time scalability

[VictoriaMetrics Enterprise](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/)’s advanced architecture and robust features made it the perfect solution for large-scale projects like Gemini for four reasons:

- **Scalability**: VictoriaMetrics can handle millions of data points without compromising performance, ensuring that Gemini's operations remain efficient and reliable.
- **Real-time Insights**: The platform provides data for IHI Terrasun’s real-time Assured Insightstm dashboards and monitoring for battery health and grid stability, enabling IHI Terrasun’s dedicated Field Services team to make informed decisions and optimize field operations.
- **Reliability**: The solution’s high reliability ensures data integrity from critical systems, even under the most demanding conditions.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: VictoriaMetrics offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for large data flows, making it a valuable asset for IHI Terrasun’s Assured Insightstm platform.

*“We’re thrilled to see VictoriaMetrics help grow IHI Terrasun's energy storage operations over the past six years. Our commitment to developing an efficient and scalable solution has been central to VictoriaMetrics’ mission, and we could not have achieved this success without IHI Terrasun’s invaluable feedback on our Enterprise product.”* **Artem Navoiev, Co-Founder of VictoriaMetrics**, stated. *“In these times where breaking heat records has become a new normal, I'm glad projects like Gemini exist, and VictoriaMetrics can support them. If we can help reduce CO2 emissions, we're making a difference. This is a win-win-win for IHI Terrasun, VictoriaMetrics, the Gemini project and ultimately, for the planet.”*
