Get ready for the next installment of our **VictoriaMetrics Tech Talk** series! We're excited to announce **Episode 5**, broadcasting live on **Thursday, May 22nd, 2025**, at **10:00 AM Pacific Time (PDT)**.

Effective alerting is the backbone of proactive monitoring, enabling teams to detect and respond to issues swiftly before they impact users. But setting up truly effective alerting â€“ alerts that are reliable, actionable, and low-noise â€“ requires understanding the tools and best practices.

Thatâ€™s exactly what this Tech Talk will cover.  
Join us for **"Mastering vmalert: Best Practices for Effective Alerting"**, where we'll explore how to leverage vmalert to its full potential within the **VictoriaMetrics ecosystem**.
