With this blog post, we are excited to introduce a quarterly **"What's New"** series to inform a broader audience about the latest features and improvements made to [VictoriaMetrics Anomaly Detection](/products/enterprise/anomaly-detection/index.html) (or simply `vmanomaly`). This first post will cover *both Q1 and Q2 of 2024*.

Stay tuned for the next content on [anomaly detection](/tags/anomaly-detection/)

**Series posts:**
- **H1'24 Updates** - you are here
- [Q3'24 Updates](/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-updates-2024-q3/)


## Releases

During the first half of 2024, we have released versions [v1.8.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v180) through [v1.13.3](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1133), which introduced:

<p></p>

- A new mode to address isolated observability tasks (so-called [presets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/presets/), e.g., for `node-exporter`-generated metrics).
- New models, such as [MAD](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#mad-median-absolute-deviationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimedian_absolute_deviation) and [AutoTuned](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#autotuned), to broaden use case coverage and simplify model usage for users with limited Machine Learning knowledge.
- Domain-specific arguments such as [`detection_direction`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#detection-direction) and [`min_dev_from_expected`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#minimal-deviation-from-expected), allowing for fine-tuning of anomaly detection models to reduce [false positives](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-handbook-chapter-1/#false-positive) and better align with specific business needs.
- A mode for anomaly detection models to be dumped to a host filesystem after `fit` stage (instead of in-memory). Resource-intensive setups (many models, many metrics, bigger [`fit_window` arg](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/scheduler/#periodic-scheduler-config-example)) and/or 3rd-party models that store fit data (like [ProphetModel](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/index.html#prophethttpsfacebookgithubioprophet) or [HoltWinters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/index.html#holt-wintershttpsenwikipediaorgwikiexponential_smoothing)) will have RAM consumption greatly reduced at a cost of slightly slower `infer`
- Enhanced support for [multi-model](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1100), [multi-scheduler](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1110), and [multi-query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#queries) configurations, enabling more flexible and resource-efficient setups.


We also improved our [documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/), including additions to the [FAQ](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/faq/), [QuickStart](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/quickstart/), and [Presets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/presets/) pages.


Let's explore what these changes mean for our users.

## Simplified Observability with Presets

To further enhance the usability of `vmanomaly`, we have introduced a new **preset mode**, available from [v1.13.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1130). This mode allows for simpler configuration and anomaly detection on widely-recognized metrics, such as those generated by [`node_exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), which are typically challenging to monitor using static threshold-based alerting rules.

This approach represents a paradigm shift from traditional [static threshold-based alerting rules](/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-handbook-chapter-1/#rule-based-alerting), which focus on **raw metric values**, to static rules based on [`anomaly_scores`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/faq/#what-is-anomaly-score). Anomaly scores offer a consistent, default threshold that remains stable over time, adjusting for trends, seasonality, and data scale, thus reducing the engineering effort required for maintenance. These scores are produced by [our machine learning models](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models), which are regularly retrained on varying time frames to ensure alerts remain current and responsive to evolving data patterns.

Additionally, preset mode **minimizes the user input** needed to run the service. You can configure `vmanomaly` by specifying only the preset name and data sources in the [`reader`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/reader/) and [`writer`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/writer/) sections of the [configuration file](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/). All other parameters are preconfigured. You also get additional [assets](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/vmanomaly/vmanomaly-node-exporter-preset/), like Grafana Dashboard, Alerting rules and a Guide as a part of a preset:
<p></p>
<img src="https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/presets-localhost.webp" alt="anomaly_detection_preset_assets_list" width="800"/>

Example configuration for enabling the `node-exporter` preset:

```yaml
preset: "node-exporter"
reader:
  datasource_url: "http://victoriametrics:8428/" # your datasource URL
  # tenant_id: '0:0'  # specify for cluster version
writer:
  datasource_url: "http://victoriametrics:8428/" # your datasource URL
  # tenant_id: '0:0'  # specify for cluster version
```

Please refer to [this page](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/presets/) for more details about the presets and how to set up `vmanomaly` in `node-exporter` [preset mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/presets/#node-exporter).

## New Models Available

We are continually enhancing `vmanomaly` to be more applicable to various anomaly detection use cases. In [v1.8.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v180), we introduced the [MAD](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/index.html#mad-median-absolute-deviationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimedian_absolute_deviation) (Median Absolute Deviation) model. This robust anomaly detection method is **less sensitive to outliers compared to standard deviation-based models like [ZScore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#zscore)**. However, please note that models like MAD are best used on data with minimal [seasonality](/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-handbook-chapter-1/#seasonality) and [no trends](/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-handbook-chapter-1/#trend).

Example model [configuration](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/) using the MAD model:

```yaml
# other config sections ...
models:
  your_desired_alias_for_a_model:
    class: "mad"  # or 'model.mad.MADModel' until v1.13.0
    threshold: 2.5
# ...
```

<p></p>
<details>
<summary><b>Example (click to expand)</b></summary>
The MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) model is particularly well-suited for detecting anomalies in metrics with high peaks that can distort statistical measures like mean and standard deviation. For instance, consider network traffic data, where occasional but significant spikes can skew the average and standard deviation, leading to unreliable anomaly detection with models like <code>ZScore</code>. In contrast, the <code>MAD</code> model, which operates on medians and interquartile ranges, remains robust against such outliers, providing more accurate detection of true anomalies in the presence of high peaks.

## Simplified Model Tuning with `AutoTuned`

We are committed to making `vmanomaly` as user-friendly as possible. Tuning the hyperparameters of a model can be complex and often requires extensive knowledge of Machine Learning. The `AutoTunedModel` is specifically designed to alleviate this burden. By simply specifying parameters such as `anomaly_percentage` within the `(0, 0.5)` range and `tuned_class_name` (e.g., [`model.zscore.ZscoreModel`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#z-score)), you can optimize the model with settings that best suit your data.

Here are the key parameters to consider:
<p></p>

- `tuned_class_name` (string): The **built-in** model class to tune, such as `model.zscore.ZscoreModel` (or `zscore` starting from [v1.13.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1130) with class alias support).
- `optimization_params` (dict): The only required argument is `anomaly_percentage` - an estimated percentage of anomalies that might be present in your data. For example, setting it to 0.01 indicates that up to 1% of your data points could be anomalous. More details and the intuition behind the `AutoTuned` mode can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#autotuned).

Example model configuration using the `AutoTuned` model, wrapped around the built-in [`ZScore`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#z-score) model:

```yaml
# other config sections ...
models:
  your_desired_alias_for_a_model:
    class: 'auto'  # or 'model.auto.AutoTunedModel' until v1.13.0
    tuned_class_name: 'zscore'  # or 'model.zscore.ZscoreModel' until v1.13.0
    optimization_params:
      anomaly_percentage: 0.004  # required. Expecting <= 0.4% anomalies in training data
      seed: 42  # Ensures reproducibility & determinism
      n_splits: 4  # Number of folds for internal cross-validation
      n_trials: 128  # Number of configurations to sample during optimization
      timeout: 10  # Seconds spent on optimization per model during `fit` phase
      n_jobs: 1  # Parallel jobs. Increase if the fit window contains > 10,000 datapoints per series
  # ...
```

## Fine-Tuning Anomaly Detection with Domain Knowledge

To provide more precise and context-aware anomaly detection, `vmanomaly` has introduced domain-specific arguments such as [`detection_direction`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#detection-direction) and [`min_dev_from_expected`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#minimal-deviation-from-expected). These parameters help reduce [false positives](/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-handbook-chapter-1/#false-positive) and align the model's behavior with specific business needs.

Introduced in [v1.13.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1130), the `detection_direction` parameter allows users to specify the **direction of anomalies relative to expected values**. This is especially useful when domain knowledge indicates that anomalies are significant only when values deviate in a **specific direction**. The available options are: `both`, `above_expected`, and `below_expected`.

- **Both**: Tracks anomalies in both directions (default behavior). Useful when there's no domain expertise to specify a particular direction.
  
- **Below Expected**: Tracks anomalies only when actual values (`y`) are lower than expected (`yhat`). Suitable for metrics where higher values are better, such as SLA compliance or conversion rates.
  
- **Above Expected**: Tracks anomalies only when actual values (`y`) are higher than expected (`yhat`). Ideal for metrics where lower values are better, such as error rates or response times.

Please find a graphical example below. `y` represents your actual data, `yhat` is a model prediction (expected value), [`yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`] define a confidence interval around a prediction `yhat`. We can see data points values that are less that `yhat_lower` at the bottom part are not triggered as anomalies, because `above_expected` behavior was chosen.

  <p></p>
  <img src="https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/schema_detection_direction=above_expected.webp" alt="schema_detection_direction=above_expected.webp" width=800px/>

Also introduced in [v1.13.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1130), the `min_dev_from_expected` argument helps in scenarios where deviations between the actual value (`y`) and the expected value (`yhat`) are **only relatively** high. Such deviations can cause models to generate high [anomaly scores](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/faq/#what-is-anomaly-score). 

However, these deviations may not be significant enough in **absolute values** from a business perspective to be considered anomalies. This parameter ensures that anomaly scores for data points where `|y - yhat| < min_dev_from_expected` are explicitly set to 0 and won't trigger any alerts that are based on anomaly scores.

<p></p>
<details>
<summary><b>Example (click to expand)</b></summary>
Consider a scenario where CPU utilization is low and oscillates around 0.3% (0.003). A sudden spike to 1.3% (0.013) represents a +333% increase in <b>relative</b> terms, but only a +1 percentage point (0.01) increase in <b>absolute</b> terms, which may be negligible and not warrant an alert. Setting the <code>min_dev_from_expected</code> argument to <code>0.01</code> (1%) will ensure that all anomaly scores for deviations <= `0.01` are set to 0.
</details>

The visualization below demonstrates this concept; the green zone defined as the `[yhat - min_dev_from_expected, yhat + min_dev_from_expected]` range excludes actual data points (`y`) from generating anomaly scores if they fall within that range. The higher the parameter, the wider green zone, the higher amount of data points will be excluded.

<p></p>

Let's demonstrate how users can benefit from using such parameters on a simplified use case from one of our Engineers:
<p></p>

<blockquote>
Currently I’m using the http_response and dns_query plugins in Telegraf to send data to VictoriaMetrics via the InfluxDB push protocol to monitor the health of the services in my homelab and meet the 99.9% uptime SLA in my wedding vows. It also makes my family/users less sad when they have issues since I’m usually working on an outage when the user reports it. Creating alerts and dashboards that track if something is up is simple but does not cover the service being slow. It is difficult to determine what slow means, especially across ~20 unrelated services, 4 dns servers, and no measurable definition of what slow is from the users. Determining this once is already a challenge, but as the environment changes from hardware upgrades, architecture changes, and services being added or removed this becomes nearly impossible.
</blockquote>

To address the case, we ended up with such `vmanomaly` config:
```yaml
schedulers:
  periodic:
    class: "periodic"
    infer_every: "1m"
    fit_every: "1h"
    fit_window: "6h"

models:
  mad:
    class: "mad"  # median absolute deviation
    z_threshold: 3.5
    detection_direction: 'above_expected'  # interested in peaks, not in dips
    min_dev_from_expected: 50.0  # not interested in anomalies |y - yhat| < 50ms 
    queries:
      - 'dns_blackbox'
      - 'http_blackbox'
    schedulers:
      - 'periodic'

reader:
  datasource_url: "http://victoriametrics:8428/"
  sampling_period: "1m"
  queries:  # in milliseconds
   dns_blackbox: 'avg by (server) (dns_query_query_time_ms[5m])'
   http_blackbox: 'avg by (server) (http_response_response_time[5m]) * 1000'
writer:
  datasource_url: "http://victoriametrics:8428/"

monitoring:
  pull:
    addr: "0.0.0.0"
    port: 8490
```

- The model chosen is [`MAD`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#mad-median-absolute-deviationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimedian_absolute_deviation) for being robust to outliers' scale
- Users are interested only in **increased** latencies (vs expected behavior), thus, [`detection_direction`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/index.html#detection-direction) arg is set to `above_expected`
- Users do not want alerts to be triggered if anomalies are **small in absolute scale** (vs expected values), that's why we set [`min_dev_from_expected`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/index.html#minimal-deviation-from-expected) arg equal to 50 (ms). In production scenarios, it may be needed to set it higher, like 500ms or above.
- It has `queries` converted to the same scale (milliseconds), so `min_dev_from_expected` arg value is interpretable.

Here's a couple of use cases, where anomaly score production was **conditional**:

**Case 1 (DNS Query Time)**

We can see shift and pattern change **around 21:15**, but all anomaly scores remains 0 ( < 1), because
- metric value exceeds confidence boundaries: `y > yhat_upper`
- configuration has anomaly direction `above_expected`: `y > yhat`
- deviation **didn't exceed** `min_dev_from_expected`: `|y - yhat| <= 50ms`
<p></p>

While it's definitely *an anomaly from technical perspective* it's not sufficient enough in absolute values to be considered a real anomaly (business perspective).
<p></p>
<img src="/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-updates-2024-Q1-2/vmanomaly-domain-params-usecase1.webp" width="800px" alt="case2-combined-screenshot"/>

**Case 2 (HTTP Response Time)**

Anomaly around **00:00 was captured** (anomaly score > 1), as
- (+) metric value exceeds confidence boundaries: `y > yhat_upper`
- (+) configuration has `detection_direction=above_expected`: `y > yhat`
- (+) deviation exceeded `min_dev_from_expected`: `|y - yhat| > 50ms`

Anomaly around **23:00 was not captured** (anomaly score = 0), as
- (+) metric value exceeds confidence boundaries: `y > yhat_upper`
- (+) has anomaly direction `above_expected`: `y > yhat`
- (-) deviation **didn't exceed** `min_dev_from_expected`: `|y - yhat| <= 50ms`

Smaller anomalies were not captured for the same reason - the deviation **didn't exceeded** `min_dev_from_expected`

## Better Resource Management

`vmanomaly` itself is a lightweight service, with resource usage primarily dependent on factors such as [scheduling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/scheduler.html) frequency, the [number and size of timeseries returned by your queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/reader?highlight=queries#vm-reader), and the complexity of the employed [models](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models).

To deal with the latter, starting from [v1.13.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1130), there is an option to save anomaly detection models on the host filesystem after the `fit` stage instead of keeping them in-memory by default. This is particularly beneficial for **resource-intensive setups** involving many models, numerous metrics, or larger [`fit_window` values](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/scheduler/#periodic-scheduler-config-example). Additionally, 3rd-party models that store fit data, such as [ProphetModel](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/index.html#prophethttpsfacebookgithubioprophet) or [HoltWinters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/index.html#holt-wintershttpsenwikipediaorgwikiexponential_smoothing), will also benefit from this feature, significantly reducing RAM consumption at the cost of a slightly slower `infer` stage. 

To enable on-disk model storage, set the environment variable `VMANOMALY_MODEL_DUMPS_DIR` to your desired location. The [Helm charts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/victoria-metrics-anomaly/README.md) have been updated accordingly to support this feature, with the use of [`StatefulSet`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) for persistent storage starting from chart version `1.3.0`.

Please find the example on how to set it up in Docker Compose using volumes [here in FAQ](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/faq/#resource-consumption-of-vmanomaly)

## Flexible Configs

Starting from [v1.12.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/changelog/#v1120), there exist [many-to-many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)) relationship between main config entities - `queries` (the data from VictoriaMetrics TSDB's `/query_range` endpoint that `vmanomaly` operates on), `models` (that produce [anomaly scores](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/faq/#what-is-anomaly-score)) and `schedulers` (that define how often the models should run its fit/infer stages). Together, it allows flexible configurations in a single vmanomaly service, to name a few use cases:

To define **what [queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/reader/?highlight=queries#vm-reader) to run a particular model on**, see `queries` arg docs [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models#queries). Different data subsets may expose different patterns, thus, requiring different [model class](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#model-types) to run on.

```yaml
# other config sections ...
models:
  m1:  # model alias
    # other model params, like 'class'
    # i.e., if your `queries` in `reader` section has exactly q1, q2, q3 aliases
    queries: ['q1', 'q2']   # so `m1` model won't be run on results produced by `q3` query
    # if not set, `queries` arg is created and propagated 
    # with all query aliases found in `queries` arg of `reader` section
  m2:
    # other model params, like 'class'
    # i.e., if your `queries` in `reader` section has exactly q1, q2, q3 aliases
    queries: ['q3']   # so `m1` model won't be run on results produced by `q1`, `q2` queries
```

To split the **models onto different [schedulers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/scheduler/)**. For example, simpler models might be retrained `fit_every` = each 1h on `fit_window` = 1d, while complex models may require bigger data frames and less frequent retrainings (i.e. `fit_window` = 1w and `fit_every` = each 1d). You can also attach the same models to multiple schedulers, if needed. See [`schedulers`] arg docs [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/models/#schedulers).

```yaml
# other config sections ...
schedulers:
  sc_daily:  # scheduler alias
    class: 'periodic'
    fit_every: '1h'
    fit_window: '1d'
    infer_every: '1m'
  sc_weekly:
    class: 'periodic'
    fit_every: '1d'
    fit_window: '7d'
    infer_every: '5m'
models:
  m1:  # model alias
    class: 'zscore'
    # if not set, `schedulers` arg is created and propagated 
    # with all scheduler aliases found in `schedulers` section
    schedulers: ['sc_daily']
    # other model args ...
  m2:  # model alias
    class: 'prophet'
    schedulers: ['sc_weekly']
    # other model args ...
```

To attach the **same [query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/reader/?highlight=queries#vm-reader) to different models**, i.e. to reduce [false positives](/blog/victoriametrics-anomaly-detection-handbook-chapter-1/#false-positive) by composing smarter alerting rules with voting aggregation, like `(avg(anomaly_score) by (for)) > 1`, where `for` label, produced by [`writer`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/anomaly-detection/components/writer/?highlight=for:#vm-writer) holds a query alias, and the anomaly scores will be averaged for all the models that were attached to the query.

```yaml
# other config sections ...
reader:
  class: 'vm'
  # other vmreader args ...
  queries:  # alias: MetricsQL expression
    q1: 'expr1'
    q2: 'expr2'
    q3: 'expr3'
models:
  m1:  # model alias
    class: 'zscore'
    queries: ['q1', 'q2', 'q3']  # list of aliases
    # other model args ...
  m2:  # model alias
    class: 'prophet'
    queries: ['q2', 'q3']  # list of aliases
    # other model args ...
```
