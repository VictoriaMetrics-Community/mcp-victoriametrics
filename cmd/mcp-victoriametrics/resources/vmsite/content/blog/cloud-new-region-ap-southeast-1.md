Weâ€™re thrilled to announce a new deployment option for
[VictoriaMetrics Cloud](https://victoriametrics.com/products/cloud/):
users can now launch their VictoriaMetrics deployments in the **Asia Pacific** region â€”
specifically in AWS **ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)**!

This addition completes the offering to our previously available regions in **Europe** and the **United States**,
responding directly to customer requests asking for VictoriaMetrics Cloud availability closer
to their infrastructure and teams in Asia. In a nutshell, this means **lower latency and regional data sovereignty**.

This new expansion comes, as we already anticipated in our
[Q2 2025 updates](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/q2-2025-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/)
blog post, right after adding new features like enhanced multi-tenancy for Access Tokens,
the new [MCP Server integration](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/q2-2025-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/),
and analytics tools to identify which metrics you really use â€” so you can save more while doing more.
