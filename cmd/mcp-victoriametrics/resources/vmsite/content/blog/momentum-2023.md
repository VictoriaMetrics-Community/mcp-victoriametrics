## The most cost efficient product on the market 

Enterprises flock to VictoriaMetrics thanks to its operational simplicity and outstanding data storage capacity, making it far more cost-efficient than competitors. This design reduces the energy required for data processing and storage by up to 90% compared to similar technologies. It uses significantly less CPU, RAM, and storage space compared to contemporaries, resulting in up to [10x cost savings for customers like Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/monitoring-with-victoriametrics/).

## Make way for VictoriaLogs 

A milestone for the team this year was the introduction of [VictoriaLogs](/products/victorialogs/), built upon the same principles that have driven VictoriaMetrics since its inception: simplicity, reliability and cost-efficiency. Early feedback shows that **VictoriaLogs is up to 30x less expensive** than other open-source solutions for logs, **requiring up to 30x less RAM and up to 15x less disk space** than comparable production workloads.

VictoriaLogs is expected to hit over 10,000 downloads by the end of the year, six months after launching.

Roman Khavronenko, one of our Co-founders and engineer stated, “Our team is thrilled with the progress and feedback we’ve received this year, but it doesn't stop there. We’re excited to see where our innovation and product development takes us in 2024”.
