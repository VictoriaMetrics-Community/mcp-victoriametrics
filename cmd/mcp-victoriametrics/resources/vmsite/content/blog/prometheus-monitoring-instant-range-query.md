<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Prometheus Monitoring: Instant Queries and Range Queries Explained</figcaption>

This discussion is part of the basic monitoring series, an effort to clarify monitoring concepts for both beginners and experienced users:

1. [Counters, Gauges, Histograms & Summaries](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-metrics-counters-gauges-histogram-summaries/)
2. Instant Queries and Range Queries Explained (We're here)
3. [Functions, Subqueries, Operators, and Modifiers](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-function-operator-modifier/)
4. [Alerting Rules, Recording Rules, and Alertmanager](/blog/alerting-recording-rules-alertmanager/)

Over the years, we've received many questions about MetricsQL/PromQL, even from experienced users—especially regarding range queries and instant queries. This article is basic but turns out to be really important to explain why your query behaves the way it does.

## Vector & Query

A query can return four different types of data: instant vector, range vector, scalar, and string. But for now, let's stick to the two that matter most when working with timeseries data: instant vectors and range vectors.

At its core, querying is about pulling timeseries data and running calculations to make sense of it.

The simplest type of query is just a metric name. For example, if you run:

```go
query: `node_cpu_usage` 
```

You'll get CPU usage across all servers:

```go
// result:
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 100 @ 15:30:00
node_cpu_usage{instance="server2"} 50 @ 15:30:00
```

If you're only interested in a specific server, you can filter it down with a **label selector**:

```go
query: `node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"}`
```
```go
// result:
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 100 @ 15:30:00
```

Straightforward so far; but things don't stay that simple for long. There's another layer to this: instant queries and range queries.

- **Instant query**: Evaluates your expression at a single point in time.
- **Range query**: Evaluates your expression repeatedly over **a period of time** (e.g., every 5 minutes at 00:00, 00:05, 00:10 …). It gives you multiple values over that period and allows you to see how the metric changes over time, typically visualized as a graph.

Looking at the earlier examples, each timeseries only had one value at a specific timestamp. So does that mean `node_cpu_usage` and `node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"}` are instant queries?

Not exactly. These aren't instant queries or range queries; they're **expressions** evaluated as instant query. More specifically, these are called **instant vector selectors**.

As the name suggests, evaluating instant vector selectors always returns an instant vector, meaning a single sample per timeseries. Whether you see them as an instant query or a range query depends on how they're evaluated—through the query editor or API.

You can set the expression to be evaluated as a range query in Grafana.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Selecting query type in metrics explorer</figcaption>

Now, results start looking different:

```go
// result:
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 100 @ 15:30:00
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 75 @ 15:35:00
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 74 @ 15:40:00
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 65 @ 15:45:00
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 70 @ 15:50:00
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 58 @ 15:55:00
```

Instead of just one sample at the evaluation time, now there's data over a range—from 15:30 to 15:55. That's because this was evaluated as a range query.

So just to clear things up; expressions like `node_cpu_usage` and `node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"}` aren't queries on their own. They're just selectors that can be evaluated as either an instant query or a range query.

### Instant Vector

An instant vector is a set of timeseries where each timeseries has only one sample, the most recent value at the time the query runs. If you run `node_cpu_usage` at 15:30, it will return the sample recorded closest to but not after 15:30.

Since an instant query runs only **once**, it naturally returns a single sample per timeseries. This is why instant queries typically return instant vectors—though, as we'll see later, that's not always the case.

For example, if you evaluate `node_cpu_usage` as an instant query, you'll get the latest recorded values for all servers:

```go
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 100
node_cpu_usage{instance="server2"} 50
```

This gives the current CPU usage for different servers. Even though there are many data points recorded over time, the query returns only one sample per timeseries, the latest one:

![Instant vector showing current CPU usage](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-instant-range-query/instant-query-cpu.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Instant vector showing current CPU usage</figcaption>

Wait, something is missing here. `node_cpu_usage{instance="server3"}` is not in the result.

That's because monitoring systems don't always return data for every timeseries if there isn't a recent enough sample. By default, most monitoring tools look back 5 minutes for the most recent sample. This timeframe is called the **lookback delta** (also known as the lookbehind window or lookback window).

In the diagram, the red dot represents `node_cpu_usage{instance="server3"}`, but its last recorded sample was too far from 00:30, so it does not appear in the result. But how much time is too far?

- In Prometheus, the lookback delta defaults to 5 minutes. You can change it using the `--query.lookback-delta` flag.
- In VictoriaMetrics, there is no default lookback delta. It automatically decides based on the time gap between samples (range query) or step size (instant query). You can override it using the `-search.maxLookback=5m` flag.

> [!TIP] Tip: Adjusting the lookback delta
> VictoriaMetrics lets you set `max_lookback` directly in API queries. You can also override it with the `-search.setLookbackToStep` flag. The concept of step will be explained in the next section.

If you prefer not to change any flags or configuration, the `last_over_time()` function is a good option:

```go
last_over_time(node_cpu_usage[10m])
```

Behind the scenes, an instant query like `node_cpu_usage` is automatically converted to `last_over_time(node_cpu_usage[5m])` in Prometheus. In VictoriaMetrics, it becomes `default_rollup(node_cpu_usage[<autogenerated_window>])` with a window generated based on your metric's characteristics.

### Range Vector

A range vector is a set of timeseries where **each timeseries holds multiple samples** over a specific time range. 

Instead of capturing just the latest value, it provides a window into how a metric has changed over time. This makes it useful for calculations that rely on historical data, like averages, trends, or rate calculations.

The chart below shows a range vector:

![Range vector capturing historical data points](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-instant-range-query/range-vector-metrics.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Range vector capturing historical data points</figcaption>

An instant vector selector like `node_cpu_usage` typically returns one sample per time series. However, when evaluated as a range query, it's evaluated at multiple timestamps across the time range. Each evaluation returns an instant vector, meaning a range vector is basically a collection of instant vectors distributed over time:

![Instant vectors captured at multiple timestamps](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-instant-range-query/instant-vs-range-vector.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Instant vectors captured at multiple timestamps</figcaption>

```go
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 75 @ 00:10
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 74 @ 00:15
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 65 @ 00:20
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 70 @ 00:25
node_cpu_usage{instance="server1"} 58 @ 00:30

node_cpu_usage{instance="server2"} 22 @ 00:10
node_cpu_usage{instance="server2"} 50 @ 00:15
node_cpu_usage{instance="server2"} 46 @ 00:20
node_cpu_usage{instance="server2"} 81 @ 00:25
node_cpu_usage{instance="server2"} 69 @ 00:30
```

The monitoring system evaluates this query at 00:10, 00:15, 00:20, 00:25, and 00:30—essentially taking snapshots every 5 minutes.

That 5-minute interval is called the **step**, which is usually configurable in query editors like [vmui](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/app/vmui) or Grafana. Most of the time, the step is automatically determined based on the selected time range.

When you submit a range query, the query editor sends a request with a `step` parameter:

```go
GET | POST /api/v1/query_range?query=...&start=...&end=...&step=...&timeout=...
```

> [!IMPORTANT] Question! 
> _"My metrics were scraped at 00:09, 00:13, and 00:16—so why does the result show data at 00:10, 00:15, and 00:20?"_

Since a range query is really just a collection of multiple instant queries, the monitoring system applies lookback delta to find the most recent sample for each step.

![Applying lookback delta in range queries](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-instant-range-query/lookback-delta-query.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Applying lookback delta in range queries</figcaption>

Here's what's happening:

- **At 00:10**: The system evaluates the expression, looks back 5 minutes and finds the last recorded sample at 00:09. So it records that value for 00:10.
- **At 00:15**: It looks back again and finds the last recorded sample at 00:13. So it records that for 00:15.
- **At 00:20**: The last recorded sample before that step is 00:16. So that's the value for 00:20.

#### Time-based Factors

We've covered lookback delta and step, but there's one more key concept to get familiar with—the **window** in the range selector `[window]`.

Evaluating `node_cpu_usage` as an instant vector selector returns 1 sample per timeseries. But adding a window (e.g., `[5m]`) turns it into a **range vector selector**. Now, instead of just the latest value, it returns all the samples recorded in that 5-minute window.

This is particularly useful when applying rollup functions to summarize data over time. For example, to find the maximum CPU usage in the last 3 minutes (window) for every 5 minutes (step), you'd use this query:

```go
query: max_over_time(node_cpu_usage[3m])
step: 5m
start: 00:00
end: 00:30
```

The system retrieves all the data points in the last 3 minutes to **find the max value** in those data points. 

This process repeats across the time range, emitting a new sample every 5 minutes:

![Applying max_over_time to range vector](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-instant-range-query/rollup-max-over-time.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Applying max_over_time to range vector</figcaption>

Notice that the fourth data point is missing. That happens because the system looks back 3 minutes from 00:25, but there are no recorded samples in that window, so it has nothing to work with.

The range selector can also define its own `step` by writing it directly using `[window:step]`. However, this really comes into play when working with subqueries, so we'll hold off on that for now.

### Range Vector Selector

So far, we haven't talked about what happens if you run a range vector selector (e.g., `http_requests_total[5m]`) as an instant query or a range query. What we did previously was put the range selector into a function, e.g., `last_over_time(http_requests_total[5m])`.

Let's remind ourselves a bit: an instant vector selector evaluates to an instant vector. But if a range selector `[window]` is included, the result is a range vector each time the query runs, or multiple samples per timeseries. 

This raises a few questions when evaluating a range vector selector as:

- an **instant query**: There's no `step` parameter—the expression is only evaluated once but returns many samples. So how are these samples distributed through the time range?
- a **range query**: Each evaluation returns a range vector instead of a single sample. How does that work on a timeseries chart?

#### Evaluating as an Instant Query

Evaluating `http_requests_total[5m]` as an instant query returns **raw samples** from T-5m to T. If you run this query in Grafana or any other editor that supports instant queries, from 00:00 to 23:00, the result might look a bit strange—it will only include samples from 22:55 to 23:00:

![Instant query returning raw range selector samples](/blog/prometheus-monitoring-instant-range-query/raw-samples-range-selector.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Instant query returning raw range selector samples</figcaption>

By **raw samples**, I mean that lookback delta and step aren't applied—so the returned data points aren't evenly spaced. 

Normally, lookback delta fills in missing samples at each step interval. But since this expression is evaluated only once, there's no step interval to work with. As a result, the system simply returns the data with the **original scrape (or push) timestamps**, exactly as stored.

#### Evaluating as a Range Query

In Prometheus, running `http_requests_total[5m]` as a range query doesn't work. This is a common mistake that many people make. You'll get an error:

```go
query: http_requests_total[5m]

// result:
bad_data: invalid parameter "query": invalid expression type "range vector" 
for range query, must be Scalar or instant Vector
```

Prometheus expects **one sample per timeseries at each evaluation step**.

That's how it builds a continuous timeseries for charting. But this expression evaluates to a range vector, which returns multiple samples for each step, which doesn't fit the expected format—so the system refuses to process it.

VictoriaMetrics, on the other hand, handles this case gracefully without errors. 

It assumes the query is meant to retrieve samples every 5 minutes from start to end. So, when used in a range query, `http_requests_total[5m]` behaves just like `last_over_time(http_requests_total[5m])`, pulling the most recent value for each step.
