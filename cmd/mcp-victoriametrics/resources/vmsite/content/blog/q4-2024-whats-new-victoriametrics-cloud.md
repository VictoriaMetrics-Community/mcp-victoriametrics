It’s been an exciting journey since we launched VictoriaMetrics Cloud,
empowering many with a managed, simple, reliable, and efficient monitoring solution
[to reduce monitoring costs by up to 5x](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/victoriametrics-cloud-reduces-monitoring-costs-by-5x/).
Designed to eliminate the overhead of running infrastructure, VictoriaMetrics Cloud has proven to be a game-changer,
offering the scalability and power of the popular VictoriaMetrics open-source time-series database with added Enterprise features but,
this time, fully managed. This means that users can focus on their own operations and code while we
take care of managing the monitoring infrastructure with automated backups and scalability in a
pay-as-you-go billing format.

In our [Q3 update](https://www.youtube.com/live/KcWJXAhNUTA?feature=shared&t=2017), we shared how new
integrations, together with a new cluster topology and a lot of quality of life improvements are
freeing enterprises from infrastructure maintenance while providing deep, actionable insights.

Today, as we start a new year, in case you missed our latest
[Virtual Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1SBAUy563M),
we wanted to tell you more about the latest and greatest enhancements of
[VictoriaMetrics Cloud](https://victoriametrics.com/products/cloud/).
These updates include two new integrations, improved billing features, enriched documentation, a more
user-friendly interface, and enhanced usability—each designed to make your monitoring experience even
smoother and more productive.

But that’s not all—read on to see what’s next on the horizon for VictoriaMetrics Cloud!

## Integrations

VictoriaMetrics Cloud already provides many ways of facilitating data ingestion, visualization, retrieval
or even notifications from various different sources and technologies. All the way from enabling
[Kubernetes monitoring](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/how-to-monitor-k8s/#),
[setting up alerts](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/alertmanager-setup-for-deployment/),
collecting workloads data via VMAgent and Vector, up to dashboarding in Perses or Grafana. This work
keeps evolving and, this time, we are adding two more integrations to the mix.

{{<image href="/blog/q4-2024-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/integrations.webp" alt="Integrations available in VictoriaMetrics Cloud"  width="{{ 35 }}">}}

Before jumping into it, remember that integrating VictoriaMetrics Cloud is super easy. This is because
VictoriaMetrics is compatible with nearly every protocol out there (and if we are missing something,
[let us know!](https://victoriametrics.com/contact-us/)).  Based on this flexibility, **it all comes
down to just tweak some read or write tokens**. That’s it! In any case, we know that the landscape is
vast, and going through documentation of every tool can be exhausting. That’s why we aim at easing
this experience for our cloud users with direct and easy step-by-step guides embedded in the
VictoriaMetrics Cloud user interface.

In any case, if you are interested in knowing how it’s done, now we summarize the needed steps for the
two brand new integrations that you can find in the latest version of VictoriaMetrics Cloud:  Agentless
AWS monitoring service with CloudWatch via Data Firehose and curl.

### CloudWatch integration
This is a great addition for those users who want to observe their workloads and platforms running on
AWS, and export
[metrics from Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html).
In this case, the data transport will be
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) through [Amazon Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/firehose/).
By the way, if you want to learn more about this integration feel free to read more in
[this article](https://itnext.io/victoriametrics-cloud-integration-with-aws-data-firehose-for-cloudwatch-metrics-2420c53dc854)
in [ITNEXT](https://itnext.io/) written by [Arseny Zinchenko](https://setevoy.medium.com/).

{{<image href="/blog/q4-2024-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/cloudwatch.webp" alt="CloudWatch integration in VictoriaMetrics Cloud">}}

All in all, you just need to follow these steps:

1. Create a Firehose Stream in the AWS Console with **Direct PUT** as *Source* and *HTTP Endpoint* as
**Destination**, and give it a name.

2. We will be using the OpenTelemetry write url, which will look something like:
   - Url:  `https://<your_cluster_url>/opentelemetry/api/v1/push` or `https://<your_cluster_url>/insert/0/opentelemetry/api/v1/push`
if you are running the cluster version.
   - Access key: `Bearer *******` (your write bearer token)
   - Encoding: `GZIP`

1. Configure an S3 bucket

2. After that, **Create a metric stream** in AWS CloudWatch with the destination towards the just
created **Custom setup with Firehose**, and give it a name.

Since we exported these metrics to VictoriaMetrics Cloud via OpenTelemetry, we need to take into account
that there’s a difference between formats when querying. But fear not! To automatically convert
metrics to Prometheus-compatible format, we just need to activate the `opentelemetry.usePrometheusNaming`
flag on the Settings tab (in "Advanced settings" section):

{{<image href="/blog/q4-2024-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/otelflag.webp" alt="Activating OpenTelemetry-to-Prometheus naming flag">}}

It wasn’t that hard, right? Remember that you can find a step-by-step guide on how to perform this
integration inside the User Interface.

### Read, query and export data with curl

Fancy dashboards and modern integrations are great, and we love them! But sometimes we just need
to curl our way out of many situations. Whether we are trying to add manually some data for tests,
at scale in production with automations in kilometric bash scripts, or even exporting some metrics
inside a Jenkins job for later analysis, curl-ing an API is just useful and handy.

That’s why we have included this simple, yet powerful, integration to guide you through it.
As it happened with our previous integration, you will find this information right in the User
Interface with a wizard guiding your steps!

{{<image href="/blog/q4-2024-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/curl.webp" alt="Read, query and export data with curl ">}}

Of course it cannot be easier! Remember, we just need to obtain our Read or Write **Access tokens**
from our VictoriaMetrics Cloud deployment, and add them to the Authorization header:

#### Pushing data with curl:

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  -X POST 'https://<your_cluster_url>/insert/0/prometheus/api/v1/import/prometheus' \
  -d 'foo{bar="baz"} 123'
```

#### Querying data with curl:

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  'https://<your_cluster_url>/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/query' \
  -d 'query=sum(foo)'
```

#### Exporting data with curl:

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>' \
  'https://<your_cluster_url>/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/export' \
  -d 'match={__name__=~".*"}'
```
Of course, you can also use other [APIs available in VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/url-examples/).


## Billing enhancements

_“Where did I put this invoice?” “Was I already charged for this?” “Did I forget to pay that one?”..._

If these questions sound familiar, this enhancement is for you. After collecting feedback from our
users it became clear that, apart from the notifications and AWS centralized page for payments, we
needed an Invoices page to look and download all receipts from a single page while tracking their
status for past and near future payments via credit card.

You can find the new info under the Invoices together with your Usage and Payment methods tabs.

{{<image href="/blog/q4-2024-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/billing-2.webp" alt="New Invoices tab in the billing page">}}

## Documentation improvements
_If it’s not documented, it doesn’t exist._ That’s a law in software as true as the fact that
deploying on Fridays is not a great idea. That’s why we continue improving our docs. Check out
our new [Billing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/billing/),
[Audit logs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/audit-logs/) and
[VictoriaMetrics Cloud API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics-cloud/api/)
documentation pages and let us know what you think!

{{<image href="/blog/q4-2024-whats-new-victoriametrics-cloud/docs.webp" alt="Documentation Section with Product Information and Guides">}}

## UI and Usability
The last thing we wanted to mention, (but it’s really, **really** taking a lot of our attention
for this last part of the year) is the improvements we are doing based on your invaluable feedback
to the User Interface navigation and usability.

We are investing in major changes that will make our page more reactive (wink, wink), which are
already noticeable with reduced loading times and smoother navigation. This is an extremely important
task that unblocks future improvements that we are already planning. Stay tuned for more!

## What’s Next?
The VictoriaMetrics Cloud team is excited to continue enhancing our users’ experience based on
feedback, and we’ll always focus on improving usability and navigation, making it even easier to
use the managed monitoring setup.

Also, we are already working on new Alert Manager deployment options, expanded integrations,
support for Organizations management directly within the cloud UI and a new way to monitor and manage
your cloud deployments. Stay tuned, because the new updates are big!

Last but not least… Have you heard about [VictoriaLogs](https://victoriametrics.com/products/victorialogs/)?
